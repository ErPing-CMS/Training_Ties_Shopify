During my 17 year career as an elementary school special education and phys ed teacher, I taught thousands of kids. For many of them, shoe-tying was a constant struggle. Typically, my classes would average somewhere between 50 and 60 students, but at one point I had a class with 80 kindergarteners. As you might imagine, dozens of students running around with untied shoes was a problem. To remedy the situation, I started teaching a shoe-tying unit every year as part of my curriculum. I tested and created many different tools to help kids of different ages and abilities learn the skill. <\/p><p>Once I invented my first prototype of what became Training Ties®, several weeks spent teaching shoe-tying turned into the majority of my students learning in one class. <\/p><p>What I saw in my kids was incredible. Confidence. Excitement. A desire to teach others how to tie their shoes. All from one little tool. One skill developed. One 10 minute session. I invented Training Ties® to help my students, and I started this business to make learning shoe-tying easier than ever in today’s busy world. <\/p><p>My wife Nicky and I have worked together to improve that original Training Ties® prototype, making sure the company and our products are aligned with our values. Our manufacturer is a small business operating out of the same Massachusetts town I taught in for 12 years because supporting local businesses and having a product that is made in the USA is important to us. We have a dozen colors, all waterproof and made of vegan leather. And shipping is always free. Our family packages and ships all of our orders from our home in southern California. <\/p><p>We believe that learning shoe-tying should be fun and easy, so you have more time to enjoy with your loved ones<\/p>"}}},"block_order":["template--19077181702457__fc84c66c-e049-4d08-80ea-35ee73c191e3-1683922727340bd590-0","template--19077181702457__fc84c66c-e049-4d08-80ea-35ee73c191e3-1683922727340bd590-1"],"settings":{"desktop_content_position":"center","content_alignment":"center","color_scheme":"background-1","full_width":true,"padding_top":40,"padding_bottom":52}},"623ba2be-ec03-4ae2-aaad-f8bf5dab7092":{"type":"collage","blocks":{"template--19077181702457__623ba2be-ec03-4ae2-aaad-f8bf5dab7092-16839228691e0cabc7-0":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/step5.png"}},"template--19077181702457__623ba2be-ec03-4ae2-aaad-f8bf5dab7092-16839228691e0cabc7-1":{"type":"product","settings":{"product":"training-ties®-the-ultimate-shoe-tying-tool","second_image":false}},"fd2fa1ed-a933-4e9b-8882-a5932d100607":{"type":"product","settings":{"product":"two-color-laces","second_image":false}}},"block_order":["template--19077181702457__623ba2be-ec03-4ae2-aaad-f8bf5dab7092-16839228691e0cabc7-0","template--19077181702457__623ba2be-ec03-4ae2-aaad-f8bf5dab7092-16839228691e0cabc7-1","fd2fa1ed-a933-4e9b-8882-a5932d100607"],"settings":{"heading":"Experience the Difference","heading_size":"h1","desktop_layout":"left","mobile_layout":"column","card_styles":"product-card-wrapper","color_scheme":"background-1","padding_top":36,"padding_bottom":36}}},"order":["main","5ffc0f04-a78d-43d5-9960-3d6e538e25a7","fc84c66c-e049-4d08-80ea-35ee73c191e3","623ba2be-ec03-4ae2-aaad-f8bf5dab7092"]}
